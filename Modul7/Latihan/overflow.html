        Lorem ipsum is a dummy text used to replace text in some areas just for the purpose of an example. 
        It can be used in publishing and graphic design. 
        It is used to demonstrate the graphics elements of a document, such as font, typography, and layout.
        The lorem ipsum text is usually a section of a Latin text by Cicero with words altered, added and removed to make it nonsensical.
